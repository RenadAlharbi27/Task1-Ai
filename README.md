#### **1- File Permissions in Linux (Flowchart)**  

![File Permissions in Linux](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f17aa0a-762f-4ba5-90f8-5995ab6fdca9)

This flowchart provides an overview of **file permissions in Linux**, breaking them down into categories based on users and actions:  

1. **Owner Permissions**:  
   - Determines what the file owner can do (read, write, execute).  
   - Represented by `r`, `w`, and `x`.  
   
2. **Group Permissions**:  
   - Defines what members of the group associated with the file can do.  
   - Also represented by `r`, `w`, and `x`.  

3. **Other Users Permissions**:  
   - Specifies permissions for all other users on the system.  
   - Represented by `r`, `w`, and `x`.  

4. **Managing Permissions**:  
   - Using commands like `chmod`, you can change file permissions for the owner, group, and others.  

This chart helps visualize the structure and application of Linux file permissions, simplifying a critical aspect of Linux administration.

#### **2- Practical Example of Linux File Permissions**

This image shows how file permissions are applied in a real Linux terminal session. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Create a Python File**:  
   - The command `touch my_file.py` creates an empty Python file called `my_file.py`.  

2. **Set Permissions with `chmod`**:  
   - The command `chmod 775 my_file.py` assigns the following permissions:  
     - **Owner**: Read, write, execute (`rwx`).  
     - **Group**: Read, write, execute (`rwx`).  
     - **Others**: Read, execute (`r-x`).  

3. **View Permissions with `ls -l`**:  
   - The `ls -l my_file.py` command displays the permissions of the file:  
     - `-rwxrwxr-x`  
       - First `-`: Regular file.  
       - `rwx`: Owner can read, write, execute.  
       - `rwx`: Group can read, write, execute.  
       - `r-x`: Others can read and execute but cannot write.  

4. **Edit the File with `nano`**:  
   - The `nano my_file.py` command opens the file in the Nano text editor, where content is added (e.g., `print("hi i am renad")`).  

5. **Execute the Python File**:  
   - The command `python3 my_file.py` runs the Python script and prints the output: `hi i am renad`.

### Summary:  
These images demonstrate how to understand and manage file permissions in the Linux system in a simple way.  
- **The first image** provides an overview of permission classifications (owner, group, others) and the possible actions for each (read, write, execute).  
- **The second image** shows a practical example of creating a file, changing its permissions using the `chmod` command, verifying the permissions with the `ls -l` command, editing the file with the `nano` text editor, and executing it using Python.  

These examples highlight the importance of understanding file permissions to control access and secure files in a Linux environment.
